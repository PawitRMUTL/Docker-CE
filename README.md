# 😄 CE_REFROM - Information Management System 😄

## Welcome!
Hello everyone! Welcome to CE_REFROM, an Information Management System designed for teaching and learning. This project serves as a case study in the computer engineering curriculum at RMUTL.

## Project Overview 📍
📣📣📣 **INTRODUCTION:**
The CE_REFROM consists of a Website Application and Web Service. This project is managed within the university, and we share APIs and databases for better collaboration.

**IMPORTANT: ❗❗❗**
1. All data in MyProject is private and bound by university regulations. Any unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.
2. This information is intended for RMUTL students (under Thanit's supervision) to learn about the project.

## Focus Areas
### 1. Docker Compose for Localhost
- Look at the `Docker-compose.yaml` file to run the project on localhost.

### 2. Docker Compose for Server
- Examine the `t-docker-compose.yaml` file for running the project on a server.
  - Create a directory, place the YAML file inside, and copy the code into `docker-compose.yml` on the server.
  - Use the command `scp` to copy the SQL file from localhost to the server (`scp portal.sql /home/app/web`).
  - Execute either `docker-compose up` or `docker-compose up -d` to start the application.

## Important Reminders 🍀
Thank you for your interest! Remember:
- Respect university privacy policies.
- Follow the step-by-step instructions for a smooth experience.

Good luck with your learning journey! 🍀🍀🍀
